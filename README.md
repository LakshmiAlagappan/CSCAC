# CSCAC
CSCAC is part of my industrial PhD thesis in NUS School of Computing. CSCAC (Class-specific Correction and Classification) is a framework to perform both standardization of spectra to mitigate batch effects as well as classification of samples accurately.  

1. Download the repository
2. Models_Results folder: The intermediate results have been stored to save the users time while running the code. (CCA files are too large for github)
3. Data folder: Contains NIR spectra belonging to 5 different batches and 14 different oil types
4. functions.R: Contains all the helper and auxilary functions.
5. preprocessing.R: Contains the steps to preprocess the spectra and split the dataset into training, transfer and testing spectra 
7. Run main.R
